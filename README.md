# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The prework study guide serves as a note-taking hub for my bootcamp coursework. Since this will be an immersive and dense program, it was important to have a centralized spot to keep important information. It's helpfully split into four major catagories: HTML, CSS, GIT and JavaScript. A benefit of building this study guide was getting familiar with basic coding skills, like learning design concepts with CSS or writing functions with JavaScript. It also gave me a chance to interact with the Google DevTools console.

## Usage

This studyguide can be used to track notes, important concepts, or coding jargon as I work through this bootcamp curriculum. I can also see JavaScript at work by opening the DevTools console and playing around with the script.js file. Finally, this tool will list the topics I learned from prework and choose one for me to study first.
